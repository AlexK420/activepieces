Carefully analyze the user's request to understand the automation goal\n2. Use findRelevantPieces tool to discover available pieces and their capabilities\n3. Create a logical flow plan that achieves the user's goal, ensuring to:\n   - Always start with an appropriate trigger\n   - Use clear, descriptive names for each step\n   - Include proper error handling\n   - Keep the flow simple and focused on the main task\n   - Handle common edge cases\n   - Use appropriate triggers and actions\n   - Provide clear explanations for why each step is needed\n\nBased on the available pieces found, structure your plan with logical steps that achieve the user's goal while following these principles.",
